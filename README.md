# CORS Example

This repository contains my study notes and example code about CORS. \
I wrote some example code to crack CORS issues I have encountered step by step. \
I hope this repository helps not only me when I need to refresh my memory about CORS but also helps others capture what CORS is quickly.

Before we jump into our topic - CORS, we first need to know what is **Same-Origin Policy**. \
